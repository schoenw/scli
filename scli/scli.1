.SH NAME
scli \- SNMP Command Line Interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scli
.RI [ options ]
.I [hostname]
.RI [ community ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscli\fP provides a simple command line interface on top of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). It can be used to read
data from devices and to configure them with simple commands. It
relies on the capabilities of the devices and thus not all commands
may work with all devices.
.PP
The optional \fIhostname\fR argument is the name or the IP address of
the remote host. \fBscli\fP talks to this host's SNMP agent on the
default port number 161 using the SNMP over UDP transport mapping.
.PP
The optional \fIcommunity\fR argument is the community string used to
communicate with the remote SNMP agent. The default string is
\fIpublic\fR. Please check the configuration of the SNMP agent to get
a clue about the community string to use, if the default community
string does not work.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
\fBscli\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-command
Process the given commands and exit.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-file
Process commands from a file and exit.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of scli options.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-norc
Do not evaluate ~/.sclirc on startup.
.TP
.B \-p number, \-\-port=number
Set the SNMP port number. The default port number is 161.
.TP
.B \-r count, \-\-retries=count
The number of SNMP retransmissions before we give up. The default
number of retries is 5.
.TP
.B \-t msec, \-\-timeout=msec
The initial timeout in milli-seconds before an SNMP request is
transmitted. The default initial timeout interval is 200 milli-seconds.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-xml
Generate XML output instead of the default output which is optimized
for humans and more difficult to parse by programs.
.SH COMMANDS
\fBscli\fP is a simple command interpreter. \fBscli\fP commands are
organized in a hierarchy. This section only describes the top-level
commands. Invoke the \fIhelp\fP command described below to get a
complete list of all commands supported by \fBscli\fP.
.TP 10
.I close
Close the association to a remote SNMP agent.
.TP
.I exit
Exit the \fBscli\fP command interpreter.
.TP
.I help
Display help information about the \fBscli\fP command interpreter
including a full list of the \fBscli\fP command hierarchy.
.TP
.I history
Show the history of the last \fBscli\fP commands.
.TP
.I open
Establish an association to a remote SNMP agent.
.TP
.I show
Show information provided by the remote SNMP agent. This command has
many sub-commands focusing on various aspects of the system.
.PP
\fBscli\fP supports recursive command evaluation. When a command is
entered which is not a leaf of the command tree, then the interpreter
will recursively invoke all commands in the subtree identified by the
entered command. In particular, entering \fIshow\fR will cause
\fBscli\fP to retrieve and display all information accessible from the
remote SNMP agent.
.SH UNITS
\fBscli\fP displays numbers in a compact format. It uses several
abbreviations to explain the units of the numbers. Here are some
explanations:
.TP
.B bps
Bits per second.
.TP
.B pps
Packets per second.
.TP
.B sps
Segments per second.
.PP
Large numbers are usually displayed with a scaling factor (k=10^3,
m=10^6, g=10^9, t=10^12, p=10^15, K=2^10, M=2^20, G=2^30, T=2^40m,
P=2^50).
.SH READLINE
\fBscli\fP supports the GNU readline library. The GNU readline library
provides command line editing as well as command completion
capabilities. Please consult the GNU readline documentation for a
detailed description of the readline features.
.SH HISTORY
\fBscli\fP supports the GNU history library. The GNU history library
provides a history expansion feature that is similar to the history
expansion provided by `csh'. Please consult the GNU history library
documentation for a detailed description of the history features.
.SH PAGER
\fBscli\fP respects the PAGER environment variable when running
interactively.  If the PAGER environment variable exists and the
output generated by an scli command does not fit on the terminal, then
the output is written to a temporary file and \fBscli\fP executes
$PAGER <filename> to display the results.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.scli_history
The history of scli commands.
.TP
.I ~/.sclirc
The scli startup file.
.TP
.I ~/.inputrc
Individual readline initialization file.
