.SH NAME
scli \- SNMP Command Line Interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scli
.RI [ options ]
.I [hostname]
.RI [ community ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscli\fP provides a simple command line interface on top of the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). It can be used to read
data from devices and to configure them with simple commands. It
relies on the capabilities of the devices and thus not all commands
may work with all devices.
.PP
The optional \fIhostname\fR argument is the name or the IP adress of
the remote host. \fBscli\fP talks to this host's SNMP agent on the
default port number 161 using the SNMP over UDP transport mapping.
.PP
The optional \fIcommunity\fR argument is the community string used to
communicate with the remote SNMP agent. The default string is
\fIpublic\fR. Please check the configuration of the SNMP agent to get
a clue about the community string to use, if the default community
string does not work.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
\fBscli\fP accepts the following options:
.TP

The number of SNMP retransmissions before we give up. The default
number of retries is 5.
.TP
.B \-t msec, \-\-timeout=msec
The initial timeout in milli-seconds before an SNMP request is
transmitted. The default initial timeout interval is 200 milli-seconds.
.SH DISPLAY
\fBscli\fP displays numbers in a compact format. It uses several
abbreviations to explain what the numbers mean. Here are some
explanations:
.TP
.B bps
Bits per second.
.TP
.B pps
Packets per second.
.TP
.B sps
Segments per second.
.PP
Large numbers are usually displayed with a scaling factor (k=10^3,
m=10^6, g=10^9, t=10^12, p=10^15, K=2^10, M=2^20, G=2^30, T=2^40m,
P=2^50).
.SH FILES
