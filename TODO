- Additional command line options:
  -t --transport (udp/tcp)
  -u --user
  -c --context

- Check ASN.1 tags in the responses to have some minimum type checking.
  (Requires changes to the MIB stub generator.)

- Add reasonable error reporting to the stub code.

- Enhance the stub generator to properly decode INDEX elements.

- Fix at least the biggest memory leaks in the SNMP code.

- Add a mechanism (perhaps based on fd_sets) to tell the stubs to retrieve
  only a subset of the members of a data structure. This would be more
  friendly to the network - but why should be friendly? ;-)

- Write some more substantial documentation including a cookbook on how
  to extend the stools.

- Change the scli code to build results in the interpreter instead of
  writing directly to the output stream.

==== GXSNMP specific things ====

+ 1. change the oid type from gulong to guint32

  2. allow timeouts in ms rather than seconds

  3. generate unused random request ids

  4. do not use strcpy et al when dealing with octet strings - in fact,
     the g_pdu_add_oid() function needs to have another parameter to pass
     the value length down

  5. asn1_int_decode -> g_asn1_int_decode

+ 6. make byteReverse static in g_md5.c

+ 7. get rid of the signed char in the syntax union

  8. get rid of any printf's in the library code

+ 9. get rid of the idea of IPv6 addresses as a base type

+10. get rid of the timeticks printer (even if this means duplication)

 11. there was a missing #include somewhere

 12. add a sync table retrieval interface

 13. the g_sync_* functions do not return error code and error index

+14. add support for 64 bit counters

 15. port numbers passed to the library are ignored

+16. fix the type definitions to follow glib naming style

 17. turn #define enumerations into real enumerations

 18. there are several memory leaks in the code

 19. implement a coexistance layer to hide snmpv1/snmpv2 pdu differences

+20. fix the usage of "gint32 i32[0]" which violates ANSI C
