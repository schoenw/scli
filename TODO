- Additional command line options:
  -t --transport (udp/tcp)
  -u --user
  -c --context

- Check ASN.1 tags in the responses to have some minimum type checking.
  (Requires changes to the MIB stub generator.)

- Add reasonable error reporting to the stub code.

- Change the configure setup so that stop is linked against curses and
  scli against readline only.

- Enhance the stub generator to properly decode all INDEX elements.

- Add a mechanism (perhaps based on fd_sets) to tell the stubs to retrieve
  only a subset of the members of a data structure. This would be more
  friendly to the network - but why should be friendly? ;-)

- Write some more substantial documentation including a cookbook on how
  to extend the stools.

- Create some sort of a test suite (which is not that easy for highly
  interactive programs).

- Complete the disman scli mode and add a disman stop mode.

- Add a mechanism to switch between agents without restarting scli/stop.

- Display processor load in the stop process mode summary line.

- Make index members pointers again in the stub interface? (FS)

- Add a mechanism to retrieve only selections of a table? (FS)

- Generally check strings for printable characters and trim white spaces.

- Do some pager stuff on long results? Should we have an internal pager
  or should we just call $PAGER?

==== GXSNMP specific things ====

+ 1. change the oid type from gulong to guint32

  2. allow timeouts in ms rather than seconds

  3. generate unused random request ids

  4. do not use strcpy et al when dealing with octet strings - in fact,
     the g_pdu_add_oid() function needs to have another parameter to pass
     the value length down

  5. asn1_int_decode -> g_asn1_int_decode

+ 6. make byteReverse static in g_md5.c

+ 7. get rid of the signed char in the syntax union

  8. get rid of any printf's in the library code

+ 9. get rid of the idea of IPv6 addresses as a base type

+10. get rid of the timeticks printer (even if this means duplication)

 11. there was a missing #include somewhere

 12. add a sync table retrieval interface

 13. the g_sync_* functions do not return error code and error index

+14. add support for 64 bit counters

 15. port numbers passed to the library are ignored

+16. fix the type definitions to follow glib naming style

 17. turn #define enumerations into real enumerations

 18. there are several memory leaks in the code

 19. implement a coexistance layer to hide snmpv1/snmpv2 pdu differences

+20. fix the usage of "gint32 i32[0]" which violates ANSI C
