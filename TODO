Before LISA '2001:

o fix expansion of aliases
o improve the SNMP version autoprobe feature
o implement XML output for most commands
o plug the table retrieval memory leaks
o complete support for the whole printer MIB
o add more set commands
o implement a real curses top command (with sorting)
o change the monitor command to a simple loop
o reorganize package scli (gsnmp, stubs, scli, doc)
o work on gscli GUI

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Additional command line options:
  -t --transport (udp/tcp)
  -u --user
  -c --context

- Add reasonable error reporting to the stub code.

- Add a mechanism (perhaps based on fd_sets) to tell the stubs to retrieve
  only a subset of the members of a data structure. This would be more
  friendly to the network - but why should be friendly? ;-)

- Write some more substantial documentation including a cookbook on how
  to extend the scli.

- Create some sort of a test suite (which is not that easy for highly
  interactive programs).

- Display processor load in the scli monitor system process summary line.

- Make index members pointers again in the stub interface? (FS)

- Add a mechanism to retrieve only selections of a table? (FS)

- Generally check strings for printable characters and trim white spaces.

- Should TCP connections be sorted by connection state?

- Should process lists be sorted by CPU usage?

- What about sorting interface stats by number? Might be confusing if
  things jump up and down.

- Need to complete the printer mode.

- Need to complete the ospf mode.

- Need to add documentation and error reports on command options.

==== GXSNMP specific things ====

+ 1. change the oid type from gulong to guint32

  2. allow timeouts in ms rather than seconds

+ 3. generate unused random request ids

  4. do not use strcpy et al when dealing with octet strings - in fact,
     the g_pdu_add_oid() function needs to have another parameter to pass
     the value length down

  5. asn1_int_decode -> g_asn1_int_decode

+ 6. make byteReverse static in g_md5.c

+ 7. get rid of the signed char in the syntax union

  8. get rid of any printf's in the library code

+ 9. get rid of the idea of IPv6 addresses as a base type

+10. get rid of the timeticks printer (even if this means duplication)

 11. there was a missing #include somewhere

 12. add a sync table retrieval interface

 13. <removed>

+14. add support for 64 bit counters

 15. port numbers passed to the library are ignored

+16. fix the type definitions to follow glib naming style

 17. turn #define enumerations into real enumerations

 18. there are several memory leaks in the code

 19. implement a coexistance layer to hide snmpv1/snmpv2 pdu differences

+20. fix the usage of "gint32 i32[0]" which violates ANSI C
