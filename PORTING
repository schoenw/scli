MacOS X 10.1.1 (aka Darwin 5.1) on a PowerBook G4
=================================================

1. Copied the newest 'config.guess' and 'config.sub' to the build directory,
so that the configure script would recognize the OS release (which is
'powerpc-apple-darwin5.1').  This would of course be fixed by using the
latest autoconf package also.

2. Installed glib, libxml (these are not normally included with a basic
installation of OS X).  Instead of building these libs myself, I used the
automated tool 'fink' (http://fink.sourceforge.net/) to download, compile,
and install the latest versions - this is quite a useful tool.

3. Installed the readline library using fink also.  However, for some reason
the configure script will find the glib and libxml in the location where
fink puts its installations (/sw/...) but does not find readline in the same
location.  To temporarily fix this, I put symlinks under /usr/lib to point
to /sw/lib/libreadline.*.  After this step, configure found libreadline with
no problems.

4. One final thing : Added -no-cpp-precomp to the CFLAGS in all Makefiles of
the project.  For some reason the standard Apple precompiler doesn't compile
all code properly with the precompiled headers (this is referenced at
http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/basics.php).

Everything built fine after the above steps and it works quite well.
