DESCRIPTION
===========

The scli package written to address the need for small and efficient
command line utilities to monitor and configure network devices and
host systems. The scli package is based on the SNMP management
protocol. The implementation utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to
generate C stub code. In fact, virtually no SNMP knowledge is required
in order to extend the scli program with new features.

To summarize, the slogan for this little package is:

  "After more than 10 years of SNMP, I felt it is time for really
   useful command line SNMP monitoring and configuration tools. ;-)"


INSTALLATION
============

To compile scli, you need the following packages:

  - GNU readline version 4.X
  - glib version 2.0.X
  - gnet version 2.0.X
  - gsnmp version 0.2.X
  - ncurses version 5.X (or a native working curses implementation)
  - libxml2

The package compiles cleanly with gcc. Other C compilers have not been
tested and may generate various errors/warnings. Please consult the
files INSTALL for the building the scli package and PORTING for some
additional notes for some specific platforms.


REPORTING BUGS
==============

Please report any bugs to the scli mailing list. A bug report
should at a minimum contain the version number of the scli
package, the operating system name and version number, plus
everything needed to understand the problem. This includes a
description why you actually believe that there is a bug.

If you got a core dump, please send us a readable backtrace.
If there was a problem with a certain SNMP agent, please let
us know which agent you were using and try to catch SNMP 
message exchanges that help to understand the problem.
(You may want to run a recent version of tcpdump to catch
the messages.)
