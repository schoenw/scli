	stools - a collection of SNMP command line management tools

Description

  The stools package was written in order to have small and efficient
  command line utility to monitor and configure network devices and
  host systems. The stools package is based on the SNMP management
  protocol and it utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to generate C
  stub code. In fact, virtually no SNMP knowledge is required in order
  to extend the stools programs with new features.

  In other words, the slogan for this little package is:

    "After more than 10 years of SNMP, I felt it is time for really
     useful command line SNMP monitoring and configuration tools. ;-)"
