	stools - a collection of SNMP command line management tools

Description

  The stools package was written since we felt a need for small and
  efficient command line utilities to monitor and configure network
  devices and host systems. The stools package is based on the SNMP
  management protocol. It utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to
  generate C stub code. In fact, virtually no SNMP knowledge is
  required in order to extend the stools programs with new features.

  To summarize, the slogan for this little package is:

    "After more than 10 years of SNMP, I felt it is time for really
     useful command line SNMP monitoring and configuration tools. ;-)"


Compiling

  To compile stools, you need the following packages:

  - GNU readline version 4.X
  - glib version 1.2.X
  - ncurses version 5.X (or a native working curses implementation)

  The package compiles cleanly with gcc. Other C compilers have not
  been tested and may generate errors.


Reporting Bugs

  Please report any bugs to the stools mailing list. A bug report
  should at a minimum contain the version number of the stools
  package, the operating system name and version number, plus
  everything needed to understand the problem. This includes a
  description why you actually believe that there is a bug.

  If you got a core dump, please send us a readable backtrace.
  If there was a problem with a certain SNMP agent, please let
  us know which agent you were using and try to catch SNMP 
  message exchanges that help to understand the problem.
  (You may want to run a recent version of tcpdump to catch
  the messages.)
